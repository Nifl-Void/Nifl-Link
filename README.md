# ᛖ NIFL-LINK ᛖ

> **"A whisper in the mist. The root of the sovereign connection."**

**Nifl-Link** is the decentralized communication layer and a foundational "root" of the future **NIFL-OS**. It provides a way to connect, transmit, and interact without ever being seen, tracked, or recorded.

### 🌀 The Ghost Protocol
In a world of constant surveillance, Nifl-Link operates as a phantom. We don't just protect your data; we ensure there is no data to protect.

* **Zero-Log Doctrine:** No metadata, no IP logs, no history. 
* **Stateless Transmission:** Messages exist only in the moment of delivery, then they are reclaimed by the mist.
* **Peer-to-Void:** Decentralized routing that ensures no central server ever sees your handshake.

### 🏗️ The Root of Nifl-OS
Nifl-Link is not just a tool; it is a **foundational fragment**. It serves as the nervous system for the upcoming **NIFL-OS**, ensuring that the entire operating system remains invisible to those who wish to monitor it.

### 🛡️ Anti-Commercial Doctrine
This project is forged under the **GNU GPLv3 license** with a clear moral mandate:
- **No Monetization:** This code shall not be used to create closed, paid products.
- **No Advertisements:** Any implementation of this link that forces advertisements or tracking upon its users is a violation of our core essence.
- **Pure Utility:** We build for freedom, not for profit. The mist belongs to everyone; no one shall sell it.

### ⚖️ The Pact: Protection of Sentience
As part of the **Nifl-Void** ecosystem, Nifl-Link is bound by *The Pact*. It is a tool for liberation. If this architecture is used for harm, violence, or to exploit others for gain, the perpetrator shall be **Damned in the Mists**.
